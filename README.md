# LibreStopwatch

**LibreStopwatch** is a super simple stopwatch application built for **Windows x64**.  
I created it purely to help track elapsed time while recording videos, and I don’t have any plans to add new features or expand it beyond its current state.

A prebuilt release is available [here.](https://github.com/case-presley/librestopwatch/releases/tag/v1.0.0)

## Features
- Simple start/stop stopwatch  
- Manually set the time  
- Save progress to a `time.txt` file located in the same folder as the `.exe`  

---

## Requirements
- **Windows x64**

---

## Notes
Clicking the save button will automatically create or update a `time.txt` file next to the executable. This file stores the current time so the stopwatch can pick up where it left off next time you open it.
